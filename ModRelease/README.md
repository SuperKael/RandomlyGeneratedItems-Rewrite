# Info
This mod generates random items, with semi-random stats and certain effects/conditions.
I wanted to balance them out a bit, but haven't done a good job for most lmao

## A rough list of what it can generate

- ### Conditions 
- ### The max amount of Conditions is 2
<details>

- - While you have a shield
- - While moving
- - After standing still for 1 second
- - While out of combat
- - While out of danger
- - While below 50% health
- - While at full health
- - While midair
- - While debuffed
- - For the first 3 minutes every stage
- - During the Teleporter Event
We don't have a condition mask yet, so you could get While at full health and While below 50% health at the same time, making the item useless

- - Passive

- - - % Regen
- - - % Crit
- - - % Secondary CDR
- - - % Utility CDR
- - - % Special CDR

# What is the item limit?
INFINITY

# Why are there so few effects!?
Feel free to contribute to this mess, it's probably spaghetti code as I'm really bad at randomness.
I actually got my friend pseudopulse to help me out here, I was really struggling myself.
